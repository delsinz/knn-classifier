\section{Introduction}

In this assignment we were asked to classify instances in the Abalone Dataset into one of two 
('young' or 'old') or three ('very young', 'old' and 'middle-age') categories. The classification method meant to be used was K-Nearest Neighbours. 


\section{Similarity Metrics}
\label{sec:examples}

\subsection{Euclidean Distance}

The first similarity metric that we implemented was Euclidean Distance, it is natural to think in terms of the Euclidean Distance when the attributes are continuous in nature (the only non-continuous attribute was Gender which we converted to a numerical description, see section on pre-processing for more). Euclidean distance makes sense for this classification problem since  if two abalones have some attributes where the values for one of them are much larger than values for the other, it is likely that the
